step1-make a connection of esp01 as given.

step2-Open the wifippm code
       -->If you are using esp8266(esp-12) set GPIO5 pin as PPM output pin and GPIO4 pin as debug pin.
       -->If you are using esp8266(esp-01) set GPIO2 pin as PPM output pin and GPIO3 pin as debug pin.

step3-upload the wifippm code to esp01 with the help ttl or ftdi.

step4-After upload the code remove the Rx Tx GPIO0 and CH_pd pins.If a hotspot is created named wifippm then everythings is alright.
      If hotspot is not created then connect Ch_pd pin to 3.3v and reset the espo1(means off and again on). 

step5-open multiwii firmware go to config.h and uncomment the following lines.
           The type of multicopter----------> #define QUADX 
            Combined IMU Boards-------------> #define GY_521 
            PPM Sum Reciver ----------------> #define SERIAL_SUM_PPM         PITCH,ROLL,THROTTLE,YAW,AUX1,AUX2,AUX3,AUX4,8,9,10,11 //For some Hitec/Sanwa/Others 

step6-upload the code in arduino uno board.

step7-open the multiwii gui select the board and click the start button. Move your quadcopter and you can seen the reading of gyroscope and acclerometer.

step8-connect your phone with wifipmm hotspot and open any browser and type 192.168.4.1 

step9-move the joystic in browser and you can see the changes in multiwii gui.
